#Causes
##Description
Every day we encounter many problems afflicting society in general. Similarly,
there are people or institutions that collaborate in solving these problems, or at least manage them better.

One difficulty in this task is the coordination of resources and results. "Causes" is an social networking service which helps on organization causes and resources, allowing to organizers to create a cause, and request contributions of any kind (objects, people and others) to comply with the cause.
